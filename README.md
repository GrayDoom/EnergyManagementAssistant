# EnergyManagementAssistant

## Project Status

This project is actively under development. The current version is v0.1.1.

## Idea

Sometime I set at my seat and play too long with keyboard(Flow/Hyperfocus_ADHD), it is not healthy right?

A hard reminder such as pomodoro is not suitable for me, I perfer to know myself, and then adjust myself.

Luckily, there is ChatGPT. So this is a soft project: You and ChatGPT (or other Large Language Model based Generative Pre-trained Transformer) will adjust the energy measurement and the management.

A frame or prompt engineering for the part of "ChatGPT" side, and code part will deal with time and data and reminder and something else. This project is build on Windows for now.

It is a hybrid project!!

I like that idea.

## This project

This project aims to create an interactive tool that helps the user balance mental and physical activities in their daily routine. The tool will be implemented using a combination of ChatGPT and a local Python script.

ChatGPT will serve as the primary interface for the user, providing analysis and suggestions based on the user's input. It will generate statements describing the user's activities, their duration, and whether the user feels the need to rest. These statements will be copied by the user and pasted into their local Python script for storage and further processing.

The Python script will handle mechanical tasks such as storing data, recording activities, retrieving the current time, and calculating the duration of activities. It will support the user's interaction with ChatGPT by providing a local environment for data storage and basic computations.

The user will maintain a log of their activities in a simple local file, which can be in a format such as txt, csv, or md. The log will record what the user is doing, how long it takes, and whether the user feels the need to rest.

The user will interact with ChatGPT to describe their activities, receive suggestions, and answer questions for real-time adjustments. The information will be added to a "dictionary" that records the physical and mental expenditure of various activities.

## Roadmap and Milestones

- [ ] v0: focus on it as a simple tool
- [x] v0.1.1: Create GitHub account, repository, and README.md
- [ ] v0.1.2: make it work
- [ ] v1: focus on it as a open source project
- [ ] v1.1: complete the install guide for both ChatGPT and Python
- [ ] v2: focus on it as a product, so it can be usable out of the box.
- [ ] v3: make it a AI project, copy and paste the idea then this project can be generated with any programming language. A codeless or codefree project, and I must be an AI scientist at that time lol.
